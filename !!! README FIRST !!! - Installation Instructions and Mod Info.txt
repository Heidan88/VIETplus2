INTRODVCTION
===========

Thanks for downloading VIET! The current version of VIET is 1.4.4 for CKII 1.111. Please read through this entire read-me before starting - I'd really appreciate if you do!

VIET is a flavor and tweak mod focused on enhacing gameplay and roleplay without detracting too far from vanilla, similarly to Project Balance. Although VIET is in a playable, enjoyable state, it is still a mod in development, and I intend to add many more features, tweaks, and changes later on. While there aren’t that many culture-specific features or tons of flavor events yet, I intend to make these two the focus of this mod. A more detailed description of new features, as well as a list of all changes, additions, tweaks, and so on, can be found in the second post of the VIET thread.

Additionally, VIET is modular in nature. I hope this will offer players more options as to how they want to play their game, so players can really choose what they like and what they don’t like - that way, you can play CKII the way you want to play it, and not be restricted to my vision (or the vision of any other modder). As this mod continues to develop, I will try to offer even more customization/modular options.

If you have any problems, don't hesitate to post in the VIET thread; you can also take a look at the thread for more detailed information.

============
INSTALLATION
============

Because VIET is modular and has a few different versions, installation is a bit more complicated than most mods. Please ask questions if you aren’t sure on anything.

1. Download the .rar file.
2. Install the VIET Assets module first, located in "Required Modules". It’s required for all combinations of and versions of VIET (except for VIET Music).
3. Install whatever other modules you wish to use. Make sure you’re using the right versions - for instance, PB users should use the PB versions (obviously).
4. If you do NOT have ALL the portrait DLCs, go to “Portrait DLC Fix” in the “Customization Options” folder and follow the instructions there.
5. Launch CKII and select the modules you want, and play!

If you are an old user, remember to delete all your old VIET files before installing the new ones.

If you’d like to further customize your VIET experience, be sure to check the “Customization Options” folder and “Compatches” folders. Instructions for the various customization options and compatches are included in their respective folders. There are also other customization options included in the game via the decisions menu.

Lastly, if you want the new VIET Music, you’ll find all of the music modules at the bottom of the first post. Download and install the ones you want.



========================
OVERVIEW OF MODVULES
========================

The following modules and mini-modules are included in the latest version:

Assets: Required for all modules
Core: trait tweaks, many localized titles, and various minor additions and tweaks to enhance vanilla gameplay
Events: new events to enhance roleplay and flavor
Traits: includes Core's trait tweaks, new congenital and personality traits as well as events to go with them
Immersion: new cultures, culture-specific game mechanics, history changes, as well as other gameplay, flavor, and roleplay additions and tweaks.
Defines: minor enhacements through changes to the defines.lua, mostly small but essential flavor and balance tweaks
Music: New music. Pretty self-explanatory.

You can mix and match and choose which modules you like or don’t like. You can even leave out the Core module but have all the other modules, for whatever reason. For the most vanilla-like experience, I recommend the Core and/or Events modules. For an enhanced and flavorful but still more or less the vanilla experience, add in the Traits and/or Immersion modules.
